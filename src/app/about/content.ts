    intro: `Hey there! I'm Leon, your friendly full-stack developer. I've been building websites and apps for years, and yes—I still get excited every time I see something I've coded actually working (and not breaking… most of the time).`,
    story: `My journey into tech started with pure curiosity (and a lot of stubbornness). As a kid, I saved up every penny from doing chores around the house just so I could build my own computer. I still remember the day I finally got my hands on my first GeForce graphics card—it felt like I had unlocked a new level in life! My parents? Well, they were pretty sure all this computer stuff was going to ruin my eyesight and distract me from school. (Spoiler: I'm still wearing glasses, but I regret nothing.)`,
    experience: `I spent hours glued to that screen, learning everything I could about computers, and discovering a whole new world that I couldn't get enough of. Oh, and funny story—remember that GeForce card? Well, fast forward to 2016, and I decided to invest in NVIDIA when their stock was under $20. Half-joking here, but yeah, I totally called it. It's a bit of a flex, but when it comes to tech, I like to say I put my money where my mouth is.`,
    currentStatus: `So, I dove in headfirst technology and never looked back. Now, I'm not just the guy who tackles frontend and backend systems. I guess you could say I enjoy both sides of the coin—code on the outside, and the magical things happening behind the scenes.`,
    conclusion: `Lately, I've been riding the Web3 wave, exploring blockchain technologies, and experimenting with how to make cool, decentralized projects. It's a wild world, but it's got me hooked. It gave me the feeling when I first started using a computer. Oh, and I'm super into seeing how large language models (like the one you're reading right now) are changing the way we work. Pretty exciting times!`
