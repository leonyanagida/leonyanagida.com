    intro: `Hey there! I'm Leon, your friendly software engineer. I've been building websites for years, and yes, I still get excited every time I see something I've coded actually working (and not breakingâ€¦ most of the time).`,
    story: `My journey into tech started with pure curiosity. As a kid, I saved up every penny from doing chores around the house just so I could build my own computer. I still remember the day I finally got my hands on my first GeForce graphics card. It felt like I had unlocked a new level in life! My parents? Well, they were pretty sure all this computer stuff was going to ruin my eyesight and distract me from school.`,
    experience: `I spent countless hours exploring everything about computers and discovering new possibilities along the way. One memorable moment was in 2016 when I took a risk and invested in NVIDIA while their stock was still under $20. That move reflects my approach: putting my money where my passion is.`,
    currentStatus: `Today, I enjoy working across both frontend and backend systems, balancing the art of user-friendly design with the magic that happens behind the scenes.`,
    conclusion: `Recently, I've been diving into AWS and learning more about cloud systems. I've also integrated AI into daily workflows and I'm excited to see where this technology will go.`,
